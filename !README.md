### Introduction
This project aims to help users, specifically artists and photographers, caption their works. The idea is that a person can upload a photo/image and return a simple caption with a brief description detailing the contents of said image. It was created during the HenHacks 2025 hackathon to make images more accessible and create keywords for an image to make searching easier. Of course, given more time, this project would go further into becoming a gallery of sorts. Artists, photographers, and general users would be able to make an account to create a portfolio of their images, all automatically captioned with keywords as hashtags. The search bar would serve as a way to look into the generated keywords for an easy way to search, much like a social media sharing platform. Artists need a space to show their works easily and accessibly.

### Features
- Feature 1: Upload images (especially png/jpg files)
- Feature 2: Generate a caption and description, 
- Feature 3: For future use, a login/account screen for your personal portfolio
